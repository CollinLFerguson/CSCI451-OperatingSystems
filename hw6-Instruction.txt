HW-6    CS451   10 points       Due: November 13

For this assignment we will honor those who have been married
(and divorced) multiple times. AKA If at first you don't succeed, 
try, try again. Don't give up too easily; persistence pays off 
in the end. The proverb has been traced back to 'Teacher's Manual' 
by American educator Thomas H. Palmer and 'The Children of the 
New Forest' by English novelist Frederick Maryat (1792-1848). 
Originally a maxim used to encourage American schoolchildren 
to do their homework. Palmer (1782-1861) wrote in his 'Teacher's 
Manual': 'Tis a lesson you should heed, try, try again. If at 
first you don't succeed, try, try again.' The saying was popularized 
by Edward Hickson (1803-70) in his 'Moral Song' and is now applicable 
to any kind of activity." From "Random House Dictionary of Popular 
Proverbs and Sayings" by Gregory Y. Titelman (Random House, New York, 
1996, Page 154).

PART 1:
-------
Create a set of 4 stand-alone programs, as follows: 

Program #0 - Will always be called first and must create a set of
semaphores. Program #0 must print the exact text "Executing process 
#0." when it runs. It must then terminate.

Program #1 - Will be started sometime after program #0 and must 
adjust the semaphore(s) such that program #2 can run. Program #1
must print the exact text "Executing process #1." when it runs. It 
must then terminate. Program #1 doesn't do anything else.

Program #2 - Will be started sometime after program #0 and must 
adjust the semaphore(s) such that program #3 can run. Program #2
must print the exact text "Executing process #2." when it runs. 
It must then terminate. Program #2 doesn't do anything else. However, 
program #2 can only run AFTER program #1 runs! If program #2 runs 
before program #1 it must simply terminate itself.

Program #3 - Will be started sometime after program #0 and should
remove the semaphores from the system. Program #3 must print the 
exact text "Executing process #3." when it runs. It must then 
terminate. Program #3 doesn't do anything else. However, program #3 
can only run AFTER program #2 runs! If program #3 runs before program 
#2 it must simply terminate itself.

PART 2:
-------
We will test your code using my program (a script) that will always 
call program #0 first, but will call the remaining programs in all 
possible permutations. Obviously, to get full credit only the correct 
permutation should result in the following output:

Executing process #0.
Executing process #1.
Executing process #2.
Executing process #3.

SUGGESTIONS:
------------
Since you can only use a single semaphore, I suggest a counting
semaphore.

See man pages for semget, semop, and semctl.

See man pages for errno and include errno.h - this will make things
much easier! You can use errno to troubleshoot your code and to help
determine how to tell when a process is attempted out-of-turn.

See my web site for a new file (errno.txt).

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run on the Linux Mint we have in CEM (Leonard or the server).
2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning of your 
   program.
3. Your programs MUST be named program0, program1, program2, and program3.
   My script will assume those filenames. If your programs do not work because
   you used different filename, you will get 0 points.
4. Your program must only use semaphores for synchronization.
6. Failure to follow 3 and 4 will result in -50% of the grade.
